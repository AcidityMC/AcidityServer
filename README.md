# AcidityServer
## About
AcidityServer (AcidityServ) is the C# equivalent of a vanilla Minecraft server. This is written entirely in C#, and allows you to interact with a user interface (which was created using Windows Forms)

## Features
### High Performance
The server is designed to be asynchronous and multi-threaded, which makes it more optimized than a normal Minecraft server.

### Plugin Support (maybe?)
I plan on adding a way to make custom plugins for this OR use existing Bukkit plugins. I'm not sure if this will become a thing or what.

### Built-In (Simple) Cheat Mitigation
We have a simple cheat mitigation system planned for the server. This includes attack raycast verification, reach hack mitigations, and possibly "movement simulation" to prevent many movement cheats.

### Simple WinForms User Interface
This will come with a simple user interface (UI) made in Windows Forms.

## Versions Supported
- 1.8.8 (should support 1.8-1.8.9)
